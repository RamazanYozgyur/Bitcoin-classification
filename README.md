# Bitcoin-classification
We have three distinct datasets related to Bitcoin transaction values, all aimed at predicting target classes. One of these datasets includes a timestamp, with each timestamp representing a two-week period. Another dataset comprises 160 columns filled with various transaction values and other Bitcoin-related metrics, though the specific details of each column are not identified. We employed various techniques to eliminate irrelevant columns and refine the dataset.

In our analysis, we applied three different machine learning models. Although our performance scores were satisfactory, there is room for improvement by exploring additional models. Interestingly, the logistic regression model yielded the best results in identifying the illicit class.
